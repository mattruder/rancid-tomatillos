## About The Project
Rancid Tomatillos is inspired by Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix and Funimation.
This was a paired project for the 3rd module of Turing School of Software and Design's Front End Engineering program, focused on learning React.

With this application users are able to view Movie previews fetched from a RESTful API. To learn more about a movie, the use can click on the poster preview and get additional information. Users can also search by title.

#### Technologies

### Using the Application
Upon load, a user will see clickable movie poster previews and a search bar. To view more about a movie, the user can slimply click on the poster or title of the movie they would like to look at. They can return home by slicking the Logo at the top, using the brower back button, or removing the `/movies/(id number)` from the URL.

To search for a specific title, they can type into the live search and get movies that match what they are typing. If no movies match the search, they will be shown an error message and can either clear the search or edit it to get new results.
